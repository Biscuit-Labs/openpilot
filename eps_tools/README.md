# EPS tools

This folder is the Honda PTM openpilot fork's copy of
[RiskyBiscuit-arc/eps-tools](https://github.com/RiskyBiscuit-arc/eps-tools), imported as
recorded in the commit that last synced it. Fix the scripts, parser and tests in eps-tools
and re-import them (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)); this README and
`rwd/README.md` are kept for the fork. No firmware images are shipped here.

Tooling for reading, validating, and flashing Honda/Acura EPS firmware (`.rwd`).
Works on the current opendbc layout — no panda-submodule or `selfdrive.car`
dependencies.

Credit to mmmorks for the original flasher scripts, and to
[RiskyBiscuit-arc](https://github.com/RiskyBiscuit-arc) for updating them to the
current opendbc layout and adding the safety checks.

```

Run the scripts **from this folder**: the examples below use `rwd/...` paths
relative to it. `opendbc`/`panda` come from the openpilot install (prefix with
`PYTHONPATH=/data/openpilot` if you hit import errors).

## Where the tools are on the comma

The tools ship with this fork, so once it is installed they are at
`/data/openpilot/eps_tools/` and use the installed `panda` and `opendbc`.
Run the recommended guided flasher there:

```sh
cd /data/openpilot/eps_tools
python3 flash.py
```

The tools themselves are tracked and survive updates, but anything you add under
`/data/openpilot` is removed by the updater (it runs `git clean -xdff`). If you
want a copy that also keeps your firmware across updates, copy `eps_tools/` to
`/data/media/0/eps_tools/` and run it from there:

```sh
cd /data/media/0/eps_tools
python3 flash.py
```

## Recommended flasher: flash.py

Supply a firmware image for your exact ECU under `rwd/`; firmware is not included
in this fork. Keep a validated matching stock recovery image.
Run `python3 flash.py` from whichever tools folder above you use.

The guided script lists compatible images when the car's cached fingerprint
(CarParams) is available, checks the selected image, prompts you to turn the car
OFF, and stops openpilot. It then prompts for ignition ON (engine OFF), detects the CAN bus,
offers the recommended dry run, and requires you to type `FLASH` before programming.
Follow the prompts; do not bypass image validation or the dry run for normal use.

Every image gets the same `check_rwd.py` validation. Images that are malformed or
fail a checksum are listed as **INVALID** and cannot be selected: the guided
script is meant to keep new users from flashing a bad image, and it never passes
`--skip-checksum`. The manual `eps-update.py` path below is for advanced users.

After **“Firmware programming completed”**, the menu offers an optional
communication sanity check that confirms the EPS responds. Being offered the check
does not mean a failure was detected, and a passing check does not verify steering
operation or firmware correctness. The final menu
also offers to restore openpilot or reboot. A failed programming attempt is clearly
reported and has a separate retry/recovery flow; recovery is not guaranteed.

## Older alternative: eps-update.py

`eps-update.py` is the older manual interface and remains the programming backend
used by `flash.py`. Prefer the guided script. For manual use, stop openpilot with
the car OFF (`sudo systemctl stop comma`, then `tmux kill-session -t comma`),
then turn ignition ON with the engine OFF. Select the correct CAN bus explicitly.
From your installed `eps_tools/` folder:

```sh
# Dry run: stops before erase/programming.
python3 eps-update.py rwd/YOUR_FIRMWARE.rwd -b 1
# Actual programming: explicit --danger is required.
python3 eps-update.py rwd/YOUR_FIRMWARE.rwd -b 1 --danger
```

An expected dry-run stop is printed without a traceback. Bus 1 is the manual
default, not a guarantee that it is correct for your vehicle. Restore openpilot
when finished, or reboot the device.

If the Panda can't be opened, `eps-update.py` stops with an error. To rehearse the
dry-run flow without hardware, pass `--mock`; `--danger` never runs on the mock.

### `--skip-checksum` (not recommended)
`--skip-checksum` skips the firmware checksum check, including checksums that
actively **fail**. It exists only for advanced manual use; `flash.py` never uses
it. **Be careful — flashing a `.rwd` with invalid checksums can brick the EPS.**
Only use it on an image you trust and understand.
```
python3 eps-update.py rwd/SOME_FIRMWARE.rwd -b 1 --skip-checksum --danger
```

## Optional EPS communication sanity check

With ignition ON (engine OFF) and openpilot stopped so the Panda is available:

```sh
python3 eps-diag.py
# Pin the bus/address if known:
python3 eps-diag.py -b 1 --addr 0x18DA30F1
# Add troubleshooting guidance only when investigating a failed flash:
python3 eps-diag.py -b 1 --recovery
```

Normal results are **communication confirmed**, **communication not confirmed**,
or **check could not run**. Negative UDS responses still confirm communication;
unsupported sessions and unreadable software IDs are reported separately.
Passive silence at the diagnostic response address is inconclusive, not proof of
a dead ECU. Cached CarParams identifiers are labeled and cannot confirm current
firmware. No communication result proves steering operation or diagnoses a brick.

Exit codes are 0 for confirmed communication, 1 for unconfirmed communication,
and 2 for setup/runtime failure. `--sniff-only` returns 1 when no response frames
are observed. `--scan` returns 0 when any scanned ECU responds, which does not
specifically confirm the EPS. Cleanup warnings do not replace the check result.

## If a flash fails / crashes
A failure after erase can leave the EPS without power-steering assist. Recovery
is not guaranteed. Retain a verified stock recovery image for your exact ECU;
inspect the failure before retrying. The guided `flash.py` offers a retry menu
after a failed flash.

### Keep recovery firmware safe from updates
Locally supplied firmware under `/data/openpilot/eps_tools/rwd/` is untracked and
can be removed by an openpilot update, as can manually copied tools there. Keep a
copy of your recovery firmware outside the updater-managed tree (for example under
`/data/media/0/`), and do not run an openpilot update during flashing.

## Validate an image offline
```
python3 check_rwd.py rwd/YOUR_FIRMWARE.rwd
python3 check_rwd.py rwd/*.rwd
```

Every image gets the same checks, whatever the vehicle:
- the container structure and the file checksum;
- the headers the flasher reads (ECU address, software IDs, seed secrets);
- the declared payload length;
- both firmware checksums: the word sum at `length - 0x80` and the negative word
  sum at `length - 2` of the decrypted block.

The layout is the same for every known image, so no per-vehicle table is needed.
For example: 0x4c000-byte blocks (Civic TBA/TEA/TGG/TGN, Clarity TRW) are checked at
0x4bf80/0x4bffe, 0x6c000 (CR-V TLA, Insight TXM) at 0x6bf80/0x6bffe, and 0x74000
(RDX TJB, Odyssey THR) at 0x73f80/0x73ffe.

Odyssey (`39990-THR`) and RDX (`39990-TJB`) images also get their runtime ROM
CRCs checked: CRC-32/BZIP2 over flash `0x40000-0x4FF60` stored at `0x4FF7C`, and
over `0x60000-0x6FF60` stored at `0x6FF7C`. The EPS recomputes these while it
runs, so a stale one passes the checksums above but faults the EPS a second or
two after it starts steering.

Malformed images and failed checksums return a nonzero exit status. The explicit
`--skip-checksum` flow can bypass only the firmware checksums and ROM CRCs.

See `rwd/README.md` for where firmware images come from. `.rwd` files are
git-ignored here so an image can't be committed by accident.
